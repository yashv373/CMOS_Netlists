CMOS SPICE Netlists
This repository includes simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) netlists for CMOS designs of:
 NOR Gate, NAND Gate, XOR Gate, CMOS Inverter, Full Adder, Half Adder.

These were created by me during my research internship at the Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi in May-June 2024.
